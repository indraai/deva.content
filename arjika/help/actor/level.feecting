This is used in scripts to find the mortal level of a player, or to adjust it.

%actor.level%        - return the level of actor
%actor.level(<val>)% - set the actor to mortal level 'val' (range 1-30)

Note that the level of a player should never be adjusted in a script unless you
have a very good reason for it.  This simply changes the mortal level and does
not update any other stats (like max hp or exp).
