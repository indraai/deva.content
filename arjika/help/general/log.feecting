%log% <message>

This command sends a message to the syslog so all immmortals can see it. It can
 be useful for debugging, or for tracking the frequency of things that shouldn't occur
very often.

%log% %actor.name%, a level %actor.level% %actor.class% just typed %cmd% %arg%

will generate a message that looks like:

[ Room 57700 :: Fizban, a level 34 Magic-User just typed log example ]

The part before the :: shows what the script that logged the message was attached to.
