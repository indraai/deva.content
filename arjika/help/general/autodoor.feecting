Usage: autodoor

When enabled this toggle will automatically find the next available door when
using the open, close, lock, unlock or pick commands. For example, in a room
with several closed doors, one door will be opened each time the player types
open door until all the doors are open. The player can still specify a
direction to open a particular door.
