Usage: toggle autoloot

   Enables you to automatically "take all corpse" from any mob you kill.  You
will loot everything (including cursed objects) until you can no longer carry
anymore weight.  If this happens and and you also have autosac enabled, the
items you cannot pick up will be left on the ground.
