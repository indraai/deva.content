Each room, mob, object, shop, and trigger within a zone is given a unique number called a Virtual Number or Vnum. These Vnums are independent, so there can be both a room number 1300, an object 1300, a mob, a shop, and a trigger.

When defining and referencing parts of a zone builders always refers to each entity by its Vnum. Vnums are not seen by mortal players. Each zone also has a Vnum.  The zone Vnum for any zone is simply the room, mob, object, shop, or trigger Vnum divided by 100. For example, The Builder Academy is zone 13,
consisting of Vnums 1300 to 1399.

tbaMUD worlds are divided into distinct sections called zones.  Each zone typically consists of a single region of the MUD's virtual world with a consistent storyline.  Each zone can define its own rooms, mobs, objects, shops, and triggers. A single zone typically contains 100 rooms, 100 mobs, 100
objects, 100 shops, and 100 triggers. If I made the Sword of Cheezy Destruction, I may decide to make it object vnum 1300 of my zone.  The first two digits are the zone number of my area, the second two identify which item it is in that area. It would be zone 13, object 00 of 100 possible objects. However, never use any VNUM from someone else's zone without the permission of that person and the staff.
