p:Project89 is the recruitment, training center and battlefeild for the new war.

p:There is no war in our society, or at least it cannot be seen. The enemy has become invisible, operating behind a cloak of culture. It hides itself behind corporation, behind government, behind wealth and money, behind the lies that have been fed to us since birth.

p:The enemy says: "We are simply doing what is best for you. Trust me; because I know the answer. I own death, if you do what we say, you will not have to be scared.

- You need this product to fit in.
- It will fill that gapping existential hole that gnaws away inside you.
- This will provide relief.
- The system works.
- The system promotes individuality.
- Activism can change things. You can make a difference.
- Respect your father and mother.
- Always tell the truth. Always be honest. Love your neighbour."

p:They feed us these and many more, most of which rarely get questioned.

p:We are raised to eat, sleep, shit, fuck, work and buy—to be more cogs in the machine.
