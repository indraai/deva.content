p:There is a world beyond the one you know... shrouded by the mists of time, the world of Avatar waits for you to step beyond the veil and enter its lands.

p:End of the Line, more commonly known as EotL, is a text-based roleplaying game in which you adventure in a myriad of landscapes and realms. It is an LP style of MUD that was first opened to the public in 1989. EotL was The Mud Connector's March 1998 Mud of the Month.

p:Once in, avoid everything that moves. Only the swift thinking and swift moving survive. Don't touch anything without checking it out with a toss-away char first.

You will have your ego crushed, your time destroyed, and if you complain, there are many people whose sole job seems to be to ridicule you.
