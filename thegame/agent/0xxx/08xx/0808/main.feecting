## Jonathan James

name: Jonathan James

age: 24
born: Dec 12, 1983
died: May 18, 2008

cause: Suicide

p[speak]:On May 18, 2008, Jonathan James was found dead in his shower with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His suicide was allegedly motivated by the belief that he would be prosecuted for crimes he had not committed. I honestly, honestly had nothing to do with TJX, James wrote in his suicide note, I have no faith in the justice system.

p[speak]:Perhaps my actions today, and this letter, will send a stronger message to the public. Either way, I have lost control over this situation, and this is my only way to regain control.
