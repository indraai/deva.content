Your Armor Class (often called AC) is an expression for how good your armor
is at protecting you.  When you don armor, any AC apply that armor has is
subtracted from your standard (naked) AC value, modified depending on where on
the body you are wearing the armor.  Some items have a special bonus, and
subtract from the AC directly. Negative AC is better. Modifiers: Body X3,
head and legs X2.
