p:"Let's run for it!" you shout.

p:Dr. Vivaldi scans the bubbling fields of clay. "I think I know the best direction to run, so I'll go first, and you follow." You can just barely hear her voice.

P:"Remember to hold your breath, and don't forget to . . . " Her voice is cut off by more thunder as she races across the white clay.

p:What was she trying to tell you not to forget?

p:No more time to think! You take a deep breath and run!
