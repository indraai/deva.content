p:You are lying on a hammock woven of fine clima vines. You feel flushed and feverish, yet happy you're alive! Dr. Vivaldi is beside you. She brushes a cool, wet cloth across your forehead.

p:"Where are we?" you ask. "How did we get out of there? Did you see the ghost wolf?"

p:"We're back with the Archpods," Dr. Vivaldi says, smiling. "And I did see a great beast with tongues of fire, but in truth there was no wolf, nor any other beast And the cracks in the field were only a few inches wide, just wide enough to release a poisonous gas from beneath the ground. A few whiffs of it was enough to make us hallucinate and have the most horrible nightmares.

p:It's fascinating that the gas causes such a specific common visionâ€”I'd like to research this some more. In any event, we were lucky to be close to the edge when I realized what was happening, I was able to pull you away so you could get fresh air."

p:"Thanks," you say. "After this I'm not going to be afraid of anything in the Underground Kingdom." "That's good," she replies, "because we still have a whole new world to explore!"

p:The End
