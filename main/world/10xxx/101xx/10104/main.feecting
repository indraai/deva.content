## Refuse to Help

p:"I won't help you fight the Rakas," you tell the Grand Akpar. "War is a terrible thing. Your villages will be destroyed and your people will be killed. Our wars have always brought grief."

p:The Grand Akpar is silent for a time. "Then it would be like that here," he finally says. "But how can we avoid war? If we do nothing, the Rakas will destroy us."

p:"Talk to them," you say. "Work out a plan for peace."

p:"No," he says, shaking his head. "We can't trust them."

p:"And they think they can't trust you!

p:You must tell them what you fear from them, and ask what they fear from you.

p:You might discover that you fear the same things.

p:Once you've reached an understanding, you can work out a plan that will let the Rakas and the Archpods live in peace.
