## Swim Across River

p:You try to row back to the Rakmara shore, but the current is now so swift that you find yourself being carried downstream.

p:Desperately you try to paddle against it It's no use. And there's bad trouble up aheadâ€”foaming, white rapids! You hang on for your life, but your raft smashes into a rock with a terrific thunk. One end tilts straight up, dumping you into the wild, swirling waters.

p:You try to grab the raft, but you can't reach it. You start swimming toward shore, but you can't make any headway.

p:You're not a quitter. You'll go down trying.

p:The End
