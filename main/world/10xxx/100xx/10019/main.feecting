## Explore the Underground

p:You know how you feel, the risks don't matter.

p:You want to explore the Underground Kingdom!

p:The angel bird seems to understand. Steeply banking, it swoops down along the great river and glides gently onto a mossy plain. Nearby is a grove of tall trees. Short stumpy branches with clusters of multicolored leaves thrust out from their trunks. They look almost like hands holding bunches of flowers.

p:You slide to the ground, and at once the angel bird rises in the air. As it glides up into the dark red sky, you feel a wave of happiness. You follow its path with your eyes long after it has disappeared.

p:Then, turning to survey the strange landscape, you wonder where you will go. What dangers await you?
