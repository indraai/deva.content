## The Glaciers Edge

p:Now you stand at the edge, lost in thought

p:How could the crevasse have no bottom?

p:Could it really lead to an underground kingdom?

p:What happened to Dr. Vivaldi?

p:But your thoughts are shattered.

p:You didn't seem to slip, yet suddenly you are falling into the crevasse! A ledge is coming up fast beneath you.

p:You could land on it, but you're falling so fast you're sure to be badly injured. You might only be saving yourself for a slow, agonizing death.

p:These thoughts race through your head in a split second.
