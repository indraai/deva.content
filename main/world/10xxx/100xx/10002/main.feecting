p:As you stand at the edge of the crevasse, contemplating its mysteries and the fate of Dr. Vivaldi, your thoughts are abruptly interrupted. Without any apparent slip or warning, you find yourself falling into the crevasse.

p:How could the crevasse have no bottom?

p:Could it really lead to an underground kingdom?

p:What happened to Dr. Vivaldi?

p:But your thoughts are shattered. You didn't seem to slip, yet suddenly you are falling into the crevasse! A ledge is coming up fast beneath you. You could land on it, but you're falling so fast you're sure to be badly injured. You might only be saving yourself for a slow, agonizing death.

p:These thoughts race through your head in a split second.
