## Who Will Volunteer

p:"But what does that have to do with the black hole?" you ask Bruckner.
p:The professor pauses to fill his pipe. "As I explained in my published theory, a tiny black hole lodged in the center of the earth more than a billion years ago. It pulled the interior of the earthâ€”everything except for the crust and mantle into itself, leaving the earth hollowed out like a Halloween pumpkin.

p:That is what the gravity readings tell us."

p:"Then where is the Underground Kingdom?"

p:"It is the whole interior surface of the earth.

p:And if you stood there and looked straight up, you would see the black hole. It would look exactly like our sun except that it would be jet black."

p:Professor Bruckner lights his pipe, then says, "I did not expect to undertake this mission for some months. I only planned to inspect the crevasse and test the Vertacraft, but the crevasse is closing rapidly. I must make the descent today. Otherwise, my return path might be blocked.

p:Who will volunteer to come with me?"
