## Three Weeks Later

p:Three weeks later you find yourself staring once again at the Bottomless Crevasse.

p:"It looks narrower than when I was here before," you remark.

p:"Yes," Bruckner says, "the glacier has been advancing about three feet a year. It won't be long before the crevasse is completely sealed."

p:While you and the other members of the party stand at a safe distance, the professor cautiously walks to the rim of the crevasse. In one hand he holds an oblong instrument that emits an increasingly rapid clicking.

p:"Don't get too close!" you cry.

p:"Indeed." Bruckner takes a few steps back. "I think I know what happened to Larsen, Sneed, and Vivaldi."

p:"What?"

p:"Gravity waves coming from the center of the earth have disrupted space-time enough to pull them in."

p:The professor looks down into your puzzled face. "And you, as well," he adds. "I've always suspected that the laws of physics may be different in the vicinity of a black hole. Now we have proof!"

p:"What does this mean?"

p:The professor smiles. "It means that the interior of the earth beginning about 800 miles deep is hollow."
