## You Run From The Creature

p:You run from the angel bird—up a hill that gets steeper and steeper.

p:In the light gravity of the underworld you can run faster than a deer, even up this mountain. Twenty, thirty, forty feet at a bound! You feel even lighter than you did before. You try to leap only a few feet in the air, but you find yourself floating. There is no way you can get down. You are entombed between the ground above and the ground below.

p:You close your eyes. Then, instead of feeling warm, you feel cold; instead of feeling light, you feel heavy. Instead of floating, you're lying on a hard, cold surface. Opening your eyes, you see ice walls rising above you.

p:Now you understand. When you fell into the crevasse, you landed on this ledge, about thirty feet below the surface. You must have hit your head on the ice. What a strange dream you've had! It seemed so real—as if the angel bird put the dream in your head! But there are other things to think of right now.

p:"HELP!" you shout

p:No one answers. Larsen and Sneed have probably given you up for lost
