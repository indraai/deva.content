p:"I won't have anything to do with your brakpa," you say. "I am not an enemy of you or of the Archpods."

p:"Ig krig zaark!" the High Raka says angrily. Two Raka guards seize you and march you out of the agon. But the moment you get outside, you make a break. You've always been able to run fast when you needed to. In the light gravity, you're even faster.

p:As you dart through the groves of duster-leaf trees, you can hear the cries of the Rakas from both sides and behind you. But the Great River lies just ahead, and for once you're in luckâ€”there's a crude raft tied up along the shore.

p:You quickly untie it, and push off as you jump aboard. The current soon takes you around a bend in the river and safely out of sight.
