## The Return

p:"We mustn't waste time," says Dr. Vivaldi.

p:"The Bottomless Crevasse closes a bit more every day."

You are eager to get back to the Bottomless Crevasseâ€”your only hope of returning to the surface of the earth and home. As you strain your eyes, looking for the Raka village, you see two figures headed toward you up the trail.
