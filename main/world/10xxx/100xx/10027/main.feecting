## Faint Signals

p:You shake your head. "I'm afraid not, Professor. I don't think I could go back to the place where my friends died."

p:Smiling, the professor leans toward you. "Would it change your mind if I told you that your friends may still be alive?"

p:"What?"

p:"It's true. We received faint radio signals from a point far beneath the earth's surface. I believe that one or more of the others must be alive somewhere in the Underground Kingdom, and we have the means to reach them. Now will you come?"
