## The Tides Passing

p:When you tell Dr. Vivaldi of the advice you gave the Grand Akpar, she shakes your hand. "I would have said the same thing.

p:If our destiny is to die at the hands of the Archpods, it will not be your fault."

p:Now three tides have passed. You and Dr. Vivaldi are still waiting for the news that will seal your fate.

p:It must be midway through the second sleeping tide when the guards awaken you. A moment later, the Grand Akpar walks into your agon. With him is the High Raka.

p:"The Archpods and the Rakas have made peace," says Akpar. "From now on we shall build boats for both tribes, and there shall be no bombs!"
