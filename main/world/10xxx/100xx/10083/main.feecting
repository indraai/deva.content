## Fascinating Areas


p:"There are three areas that fascinate me equally," she answers, "so I'll let you choose among them.

p:To the west are the Weightless Peaks, where you become lighter and lighter, the higher you climb.

p:To the south are the Hills of Diamonds.

p:The Archpods are afraid to go there. They say it is too close to what they call the Lair of the Ghost Wolf."

p:"What lies across the Great River?" you ask.

p:"Beyond Rakmara."

p:"The Shining Mountains. There we may find creatures whom the Archpods call the Flying Clera.

p:They are great birds, who may be the true rulers of the Underground Kingdom, higher even than humans on the evolutionary scale.

p:What would you prefer?"
