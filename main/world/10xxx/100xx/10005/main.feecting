p:Your whole body is racked with pain as you crash onto the ledge. You're shaken and bruised but still alive! A snowbank cushioned your fall.

p:"HELP!" you cry.

p:"Hold on!" Larsen yells. "It's going to be tricky, but we're rigging our ropes. We'll get you up."

p:You feel a flash of joy; then you remember something that chills you to the bone.

p:You were very careful not to fall in. You're quite sure you didn't slip; you were pulled as if by an unknown force within the Bottomless Crevasse.

p:Should you warn your friends about the strange force?

p:If you do, they may be afraid to get close enough to rescue you.
