## The Underground Kingdom

p:The Underground Kingdom is not easy to reach. Many readers never get there. Others never return.

p:Before starting out on your journey, you may want to read Professor Bruckner's theory.

p:Professor Bruckner is a rather boring writer, and I wouldn't suggest that you bother to read his theory, except that, if you ever get to the Underground Kingdom, it might save your life.

p:Good luck!
