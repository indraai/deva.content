p[speak:Brian]:The Underground Kingdom is not easy to reach. Many readers never get there. Others never return.

p[speak]:Before starting out on your journey, you may want to read Professor Bruckner's theory.

p[speak]:Professor Bruckner is a rather boring writer, and I wouldn't suggest that you bother to read his theory, except that, if you ever get to the Underground Kingdom, it might save your life.

p[speak]:Good luck!
