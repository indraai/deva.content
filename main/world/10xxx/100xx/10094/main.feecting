## The Diamonds

p:"Let's get to those diamonds," you cry. And you run toward the points of sparkling white light.
p:At the same time you begin choking on thick sulphurous fumes. Behind you, thunder rumbles from the ground!
p:Dr. Vivaldi has reached the first hill of diamonds.
p:"They're the real thing!" she calls, sifting them through her hands. "Within a few yards of us are more diamonds than are worn by all the people on earth!"
p:"Look!" you shout, for now the fields of white clay are bubbling like boiling soup. Pale yellow gases rise from cracks in the ground.
p:"We are trapped." Dr. Vivaldi's voice sounds far away. "By the time the claybeds stop erupting, these fumes will. . . p u t . . . u s . . . t o . . . sleep."
p:She coughs and staggers a few feet up a small hill of diamonds. "Quick, over here!" she calls.
p:Gasping, you stumble up the hill and collapse in a mound of diamonds. Dr. Vivaldi breathes deeply. "We're safe for the moment This hill is well above the toxic gases." Her voice is drowned out by the ground thunder.
