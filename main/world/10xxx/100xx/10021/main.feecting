## No Shelter

p:There is no shelter from the relentless wind and no sign of Larsen or Sneed. It's getting hard to breathe.
p:You soon begin to feel the dull aches, stiffness, and sick feeling you've read aboutâ€”the dread symptoms of hypothermia; you are freezing to death.
p:Maybe a search helicopter will arrive any moment. Maybe in a few hours. Maybe never.
p:You are very tired. You desperately need rest.
