## You Run
p:You run as fast as you can, hoping that once the mother sees her baby is safe, she will not pursue you.

p:You dart into a cavern. It's darker and hotter than the pleasant spot where you found the fledgling.

p:Is it the same passageway you came through?

p:Still running, you look back over your shoulder to see if the mother bird is following. At that moment you find yourself falling, or rather rising,
toward the earth's surfaceâ€”drawn up into what must be the same shaft that forms the Bottomless Crevasse!

p:Soon you stop rising and start falling. Then you rise a shorter distance, stop, and begin to fall again. You feel like a yo-yo, bouncing up and down, up and down, until you finally come to rest at the center of gravity, the point where you will neither rise nor fall. Like a cork thrown in the ocean, you seem doomed to drift forever.

p:The End
