## What Can We Do?

p:"What can we do?" you ask.

p:Dr. Vivaldi looks at you thoughtfully, then says,

p:"If there is a war, we cannot expect to survive. I am going to talk to the Grand Akpar. But here, take my gold bracelet. If you give it to the guard, he will let you escape."

p:"But what will happen to you? I don't want to leave you here. I'll go to the Grand Akpar with you!"

p:Dr. Vivaldi replies, "Think carefully before you make such a decision."
