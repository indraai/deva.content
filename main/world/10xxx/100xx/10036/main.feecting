## The Shining Mountains

p:You and Dr. Vivaldi cross the Great River and start your trek to the Shining Mountains. Along the way your guide, Mopur, brings back mountain game, breadbush, and tanga.
p:The air seems lighter and brighter than in the valley of the Great River. Never have you felt so happy as you do right nowâ€”hiking through the Shining Mountains.
