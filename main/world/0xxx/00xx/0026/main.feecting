HIP is a place for hackers, artists, activists and many, many others to network themselves, both in the social and electronic sense of the word. HIP is a do-it-yourself event. We, the organizers, will provide the infrastructure, such as large tents, showers, toilets and large amounts of reliable electrical power and network connectivity. We'll also arrange for a basic set of workshops and lectures, mainly dealing with the social and political aspects of information technology, security, Internet, access to technology, new developments, cryptography and other 'hacker-related' topics that come to mind. We are open to suggestions for other fields of interest.

There will be a part of the campsite that is off-limits to all press. No filming, photographing or recording is to take place there.

One of the first things participants see upon arriving at HIP 97 - a gathering this weekend of 2,500 members of the international hacking community at a campground about 30 minutes from Amsterdam - is a gravestone engraved with Bill Gates' name and the epitaph "Where do you want to go today?"

And unlike the pointed pointlessness of Burning Man, HIP hopes to address concrete issues that affect the lives of the participants, such as Internet censorship, spam, and, of course, cryptography.
