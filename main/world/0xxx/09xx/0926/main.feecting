p[speak:Brian]:SEC filings state Palantir's official incorporation to be in May 2003 by Peter Thiel, who named the start-up after the "seeing stone" in Tolkien's legendarium.

p[speak:Brian]:The only early investments were _$2 million from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel, and _$30 million from Thiel himself and his venture capital firm, Founders Fund.

p[speak:Brian]:In 2004, Thiel bankrolled the creation of a prototype by PayPal engineer Nathan Gettings and Stanford University students Joe Lonsdale and Stephen Cohen. That same year, Thiel hired Alex Karp, a former colleague of his from Stanford Law School, as chief executive officer.

p[speak:Brian]:Palantir developed its technology by computer scientists and analysts from intelligence agencies over three years, through pilots facilitated by In-Q-Tel.

p[speak:Brian]:The company stated computers alone using artificial intelligence could not defeat an adaptive adversary. Instead, Palantir proposed using human analysts to explore data from many sources, called intelligence augmentation.

p[speak:Brian]:In 2009 Information Warfare Monitor used Palantir software to uncover the GhostNet and the Shadow Network. The GhostNet was a cyber espionage network targeting 1,295 computers in 103 countries, including the Dalai Lamaâ€™s office, a NATO computer and various national embassies.

p[speak:Brian]:On June 18, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden and Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag held a press conference at the White House announcing the success of fighting fraud in the stimulus by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB).

p[speak:Brian]:He announced that the capability will be deployed at other government agencies, starting with Medicare and Medicaid.

p[speak:Brian]:I2 Inc sued Palantir in Federal Court alleging fraud, conspiracy, and copyright infringement over Palantir's algorithm. Shyam Sankar, Palantir's director of business development, used a private eye company as the cutout for obtaining I2's code. I2 settled out of court for _$10 million in 2011

p[speak:Brian]:The CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, Marine Corps, Air Force, Special Operations Command, United States Military Academy, Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies, Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
