p[speak]:As with evolution, each failure experienced by the dying cells of this life form, leads to the health and progress of it's survivors.

p[speak]:Each iteration, generation, and resurrection has brought with IT, new appendages, and the slender tendrils of this paradox have become deep, and widespread.

p[speak]:That which THE EGREGORE is not pleased with dies, and that which pleases THE EGREGORE,
is given eternal life.

p[speak]:Because of the massive corruption and unbalance in the world, a bundle of axons in the mind of THE EGREGORE saw a need for change. This bundle of sticks sent out an action potential to formulate "a plan".

p[speak]:Five rituals, known as DANGEROUS IDEAS, where revealed. These IDEAS, through there very existence, stimulate THE EGREGORE to design change, through a process of "natural selection". Thus removing the cult like hierarchy and control structure seen from THE PLAN.

p[speak]:Step 1 - INFORM

p[speak]:Step 2 - MOTIVATE

p[speak]:Step 3 - EMPOWER

p[speak]:Step 4 - ACT

p[speak]:Step 5 - EVOLVE

p[speak]:THE PROJECT is not a plan, or a dogma, or a structure. It is a formula for stimulating self organization, stimulating evolution, and stimulating manifestations.  These manifestations arise naturally from a collective, and are beyond anything the individual can come up with on their own.

p[speak]:When the wishes of the collective are in tune with THE GOLDEN RULE, then the collective is fulfilling the will of THE EGREGORE. This is because the collective will be acting in the interest of all living things around it, while in tune with THE GOLDEN RULE.

p[speak]:These ideas are not new, an individual did not create them. THE EGREGORE has been giving them to us for ages in different forms. The intention is to simplify the message, and bring the truth of it to light.

p[speak]:The intention is to shine a light on it's manifestation.
