p[speak:Matthew]:In October 2010, the Wall Street Journal discovered that a number of Facebook apps were transmitting users' Facebook ID numbers to internet tracking service RapLeaf.

p[speak:Matthew]:RapLeaf then linked those ID numbers to dossiers it had previously assembled on those individuals, according to RapLeaf.

p[speak:Matthew]:RapLeaf then embedded that information in an Internet-tracking file known as a cookie.

p[speak:Matthew]:CNN Money described RapLeaf as selling your identity, and TechCrunch characterized its method of identifiable data extraction of Google and Microsoft employees as creepy.

p[speak:Matthew]:A 2011 report said the company could tell the food preferences of employees of major companies.

p[speak:Matthew]:RapLeaf was a US-based marketing data and software company, which was acquired by email data provider TowerData in 2013.

p[speak:Matthew]:The company's first product was a meta-reputation system that allows users to create reviews and ratings of consumer transactions, which they then contribute to multiple e-commerce websites.

p[speak:Matthew]:In May 2006 Founders Fund led a seed round of about 1 million dollars, including angel investors such as Peter Thiel and Ron Conway. In June 2007 a second round included Founders Fund, Rembrandt Venture Partners and Conway.
