The room is barren of luxuries that most people enjoy in a home.  The floor, ceiling, and walls are all bright white and almost painful to look at.  A bed, table, desk, and a small personal shrine are the only furniture in the room. Even the highest priest is not allowed the luxuries that they deserve.
