::BEGIN:MAIN
This room has been created by the High Council of Clerics to give aid to novices who receive injury in their adventures. For the more experienced adventurers aid can be sought, but for a price. Apprentices gowned in white robes bring water and fresh bandages to the experienced healers who aid the wounded.
