The Northern Gate of Sanctus and the impressive wall surrounding it looms above to the north.  The dull sound of hammering comes from the building to your west and no sound escapes the building to the east.  The North Way splits the city of Sanctus into two Quarters.  The thieves quarter in the east and the Warriors Quarter to the west.
