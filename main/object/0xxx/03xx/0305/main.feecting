p:MAY they who would assume kinship from far away, VivasvƒÅn's generations.

p:For worthy of obeisance are all your names, worthy of adoration and offerings.

p:Ye who were born from waters do ye here listen to my call. Looking on men they by their toils attained as Gods to lofty immortality.

p:Borne on refulgent cars in the height of Heaven. Great Kings who bless us, who have come to offerings have set their mansion in the sky. These I invite with adoration and with hymns for happiness. Who offereth to you the laud that ye accept many as ye are?

p:Wise Deities, who have dominion over the world, ye thinkers over all that moves and that moves not.

p:The well-oared heavenly Ship that lets no waters in, free from defect, will we ascend for happiness. That conquering Car, O Indra, that sets forth at dawn, that never breaks, may we ascend for happiness.

p:The noblest Svasti with abundant riches, who comes to what is good by distant pathway

p:Men are made rich by those who are Immortal.
