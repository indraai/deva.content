## Idne
p:A Friend to be besought by friends.

l:O'er all thou rulest.
l:Upon the lofty ridge of heaven thy bright rays
l:with their essences spread purifying power.

p:These Seven Rivers flow, as being thine, to give command.

l:Flow onward in a stream.
l:Driving thee in VivasvƒÅn's course.

p:Made melody round thee the Sage.

l:The streams of the Mighty One have poured them forth.
l:Like coming home, have reached the place of offering.
l:To our great delight the running waters flow to us.

p:Flow on for the great Viewer of men.
l:Flow on for gain of Idne.

p:Best art thou of the great, Strongest of strong ones, Idne.
l:Mightier even than the strong.
l:More valiant even than the brave.
l:More liberal than the bountiful.

p:Beyond his enemies away to sweet praise.
