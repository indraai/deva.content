## Don Blanton
name: Don Blanton
vector: 0x0506a
describe: Don Blanton was once the youngest on-air personality in the United States, starting in radio at age 15 in Charleston, S.C.  His parents did not even know that he was on the radio after school! He actually got his start at a Soul Music station during a time of racial crisis in this country during the 60's. His radio personality persona was that of an African American and he made a promise to the radio station that he would never disclose the details, a promise that he continues to uphold today. Several movie producers have approached him to create a movie about this time in his life. He claims that he would only do this if he could still maintain the anonymity of the people involved who may still be alive today!

Even though he as only 17 and underage, the club owners let him work there as long as he only drank Coca-Cola!

p:He was tutored by an amazingly bizarre and talented man by the name of Robert Evans, who introduced Don to a world that he never knew existed.
