p:Hypatia of Alexendria was illuminated by Meridion vote on August 29, 2003 for being "wedded to the truth". A philosopher, an engineer, an erudite and eloquent conversationalist, an intellectual leader, she was the first woman known to have made a significant contribution to mathematics. Her death marked the loss of much ancient knowledge and technology, and the beginning of the rule of Christianity, appropriately known as the "Dark Ages." Despite her writings having been destroyed, the memory of her has endured through the ages. A life so bright that not even the Dark Ages could supress her memory completely.
