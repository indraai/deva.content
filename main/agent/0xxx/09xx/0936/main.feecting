## Intro

p:Eric is also Zippo on EOTL.


p:Hello you've reached the homepage of Eric Sorenson. Hopefully you'll find this site moderately interesting, well-formatted, gramatically correct, and perhaps even useful. Wouldn't that be a pleasant change.
p:As Baudrillard would say, this site is under deconstruction. Please bear with its unfinished form.
p:To make your browsing experience as smooth as possible, I'm including a handy reference to all the different parts of this site right here.

> Computer stuff -- #Perl, #CGI, #UNIX, networking, etc.
> Internet-related things -- What exactly do you mean by "a life"?
> Musical interests -- #Ambient/#Techno, #Zorn, #MrBungle
> Personal information -- The Man Behind The Legend (ha)
> I don't have a web counter because it's SO 1995!
> I do have a guestbook though, because I wrote it.

::BEGIN:COMPUTERS
## Computers
I freely admit it, I'm a geek. I'm a UNIX sysadmin by trade, a BOFH by nature, and a consluttant by choice.
I don't have a Geek Code or an Angst Code or a Goth Code or any code for that matter (except my PGP Key). Like Ferris Beuller said, "I don't believe in -ism's, I just believe in me."
It all basically comes down to either hardware or software.
On the hardware side, I might be fixing silly problems for my users, who really need me to make them a patch cable for their shiny new Wind0ze machine, or I'm using scotty and tkined to figure out why the network is soooo slow.

p:As far as software is concerned, I'm a Linux advocate, a NeXT Cube owner and NeXTStep fan, and Perl hacker.

p:I do a lot of X Window system look&feel hacking when I'm procrastinating real work, more info is here.

p:In a previous incarnation, I was webmaster and systems administrator for an Internet Service Provider in Honolulu, Hawaii. Alas, aloha.net as I knew it is no more. Wanna find out why? My Un-bitter (REALLY!) chum Incubus has the scoop linked somewhere from his webpage. While I was there, I did a veritable boatload of CGI scripting (in inimitable Perl). Some of that remains here, but most of it should be scrapped. I also wrote a nice FAQ in two parts: the first of which was a low-level introduction to the Web, and the second of which contains HoL-subscriber specific information. Actually it's not that specific. If you have an account with an ISP and are starting to set up a web page, you might find something useful there.

p:I also worked at a company called Internet Profiles, or I/PRO as we I/STAFF affectionately referred to the I/COMPANY as we worked on our I/CODE in our I/CUBEs. It was a great work environment for a while, but being slammed by the SF Chronicle, HaTWoRlD, and C|net all in the same week proved a bit much. I did do some interesting work there, mainly involving CGI interfaces to a mSQL database. I'm in the process (hah-hah) of writing a webpage about it, which will end up here.

::BEGIN:NET
## NET Related
p:Despite all the ill-informed hype, the Net manages to keep its chaotic cool. Small communities of folks who are actually doing cool stuff, having fun, and maintaining their senseless addiction to slaughtering friends in Quake are, for me, more what the Net's all about than hifalutin theories about the noosphere. Blue's News and Voodoo Extreme keep me informed about the 3D gaming world, and I always like to finger Paul Steed late at night because he is a hunka-hunka scorchin' man meat.

p:I hereby promise to bitch-slap the next person who says (without irony) the word "cyberia" in front of me. (Note: I read the book when it first came out, and even though I was less bitter then I still found its wide-eyed naivete cloying and more than a little obnoxious, like your little brother tagging along to a party).

::BEGIN:MUSICAL
## Musical Stylings
p:I listen to a lot of music. I wake up to a CD player alarm clock, let the album spin while I'm getting ready for work, pop a disc in my car for the drive up, then entertain/annoy my cow-orkers with a fairly eclectic mix of tunage all day. I come home, probably finishing off the CD I started listening too on my way in, and play yet more music in the evening, occassionally falling asleep to a particularly relaxing CD. I'm going to try to start writing up little reviews of discs I really like, but until then here's a list of cool music sites on the net:

> Axiom -- Home of the p1mp of bass players, Bill Laswell, and his many incredible albums. Favorites: Material's Hallucination Engine, Oscillations and its Oscillations Remixes 1, South Delta Space Age by Third Rail, and Tetragramaton's Submerge.
> Warp Records -- The label of some of my favorite artists, including Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, and the inimitable Autechre.
Speaking of Autechre, here's the AeA -- the Autechre Archive, of by and for fans.
> rec.music.ambient -- A cozy home for those interested in that sort of thing.
> Yahoo's list of John Zorn websites. Be forewarned that his discography is HUGE. 400K. TEXT. That boy gets around.
> Here's a great email from Brian Eno. It's his polite and extremely self-actualised response to fan-worship. Wouldn't it be nice if other artists had as much respect for themselves and their audience?

::BEGIN:PERSONAL
## Personal
p:For all you pervs who want to cut to the chase, this is for you. I live in (mostly) sunny Campbell, California in a geek-house with two bitchin roommates, JD Falk and the Skipper, Henry Messenger. My girlfriend Jen, a/k/a Pandora spends a lot of time here too, as do a bunch of other random Bay Area BOFH's.

p:We go sailing a lot; I'm first mate and crew boss on the boat and housekeeper and cabana boy on land. One day we saw Paul Cayard's America's Cup challenge crew out practicing on the bay, check this picture out! I also have a new mountain bike that I'm learning how to ride. Well, I know how to ride it, but the going down trails without falling over and hurting myself part still needs work.

p:Our house is commonly referred to as the AngstHaus, because Henry and I met on-line in alt.angst. The moniker's no longer particularly appropriate; we spend far more time having fun, working on explosive.net projects like the NOC racks, and hitting concerts than actually angsting, but sometimes you just can't shake a good nickname.

p:Here's a nice picture I took of my Dad on one of his occasional visits to our lovely Bay (and here's one he took of me). He and my mum live in Hawaii, yes real people do actually live there. I have a cool-cat brother named Bjorn, who attends the University of Oregon in Eugene. My sister Karin is at SWTU. No homepage yet for her, but give it a semester or two...
That's about it I suppose, feel free to email me if there's a chapter of my brief but eventful life you're dying to hear about.
